Enigma Machine
John Agapeyev

This is an enigma machine, written in Java, and coded using the swing framework.
It features many of the elements in a real enigma machine.

In its current state it is finished, no further documentation or additions are planned.
	
It reads from config.ini and currently the user cannot save anything to that file.
Altering the first two lines allows the program to randomly generate keys for the rotor and reflector.
If the user wants to enter custom keys, that can also be done by altering the config file.
All user entered keys must be in uppercase letters.
